# Drupal 8 Webform Bulk Element Generator
This web-based utility helps generate bulk fields from a text input for the [Webform Module](https://www.drupal.org/project/webform).
This is useful in cases where you need to create a lot of fields of the same type.

[Web based version](https://crownemmanuel.github.io/drupal_webform_generator)

To use: paste all your data into the source text input one line at a time, define the parameters of the element and hit the generate button.

NOTE: Using the advanced mode you could technically use this tool as a bulk YAML generator to generate a YAML file with repeated lines for any other use case

`git clone https://github.com/crownemmanuel/drupal_webform_generator.git`
